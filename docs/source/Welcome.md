# let_it_be_3D

With let_it_be_3D we want to extend the functions of aniposelib and bring them into a pipeline structure.
Our goals are having as less manual steps required as possible and standardized quality assurance/collection of metadata.
We provide additional methods for `video synchronisation`, `adjustment for different framerates`, `validation of anipose calibration`, `adjustment of intrinsic calibrations to croppings`, `manual marker detection`, `checking and correcting filenames` and `normalisation of the 3D triangulated dataframe`.


## Pipeline explained Step-by-Step!


### 1) Load videos and metadata
- read video metadata from filename and recording config file
- intrinsic calibrations
    - use anipose intrinsic calibration
    - run or load intrinsic calibration based on uncropped checkerboard videos
    adjust intrinsic calibration for video cropping
### 2) Video processing
- synchronize videos temporally based on a blinking signal

- run marker detection on videos manually or using [DeepLabCut](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut) networks

      </p>
  </details>
- write videos and marker detection files to the same framerate

### 3) Calibration
- run extrinsic [Anipose](https://github.com/lambdaloop/aniposelib) camera calibration 
- validate calibration based on known distances and angles (ground truth) between calibration validation markers

        This calibration validation shows the triangulated representation of a tracked rectangle, that has 90Â° angles at the corners.

### 4) Triangulation
- triangulate recordings

    </p>

- rotate dataframe, translate to origin, normalize to centimeter

### Installation
```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/retune-commons/let_it_be_3D.git

# Go to the folder in which you cloned the repository
$ cd let_it_be_3D

# Install dependencies
# first, install deeplabcut into a new environment as described here: (https://deeplabcut.github.io/DeepLabCut/docs/installation.html)
$ conda env update --file env.yml 

# Open Walkthrough.ipynb in jupyter lab
$ jupyter lab

# Update project_config.yaml to your needs and you're good to go!
```


### Required filestructure

#### Video filename

  - calibration:
    - has to be a `video` [".AVI", ".avi", ".mov", ".mp4"]
    - including recording_date (YYMMDD), calibration_tag (as defined
    in project_config) and cam_id (element of valid_cam_ids in
    project_config)
    - recording_date and calibration_tag have to be separated by an
    underscore ("_")
    - f"{recording_date}_{calibration_tag}_{cam_id}" =
    Example: "220922_charuco_Front.mp4"
  - calibration_validation:
    - has to be a `video` or `image` [".bmp", ".tiff", ".png", ".jpg",
    ".AVI", ".avi", ".mp4"]
    - including recording_date (YYMMDD), calibration_validation_tag
    (as defined in project_config) and cam_id (element of valid_cam_ids
    in project_config)
    - recording_date and calibration_validation_tag have to be separated
    by an underscore ("_")
    - calibration_validation_tag mustn't be "calvin"
    - f"{recording_date}_{calibration_validation_tag}" =
    Example: "220922_position_Top.jpg"
  - recording:
    - has to be a `video` [".AVI", ".avi", ".mov", ".mp4"]
    - including recording_date (YYMMDD),
    cam_id (element of valid_cam_ids in project_config),
    mouse_line (element of animal_lines in project_config),
    animal_id (beginning with F, split by "-" and followed by a number)
    and paradigm (element of paradigms in project_config)
    - recording_date, cam_id, mouse_line, animal_id and paradigm have to be separated by an underscore ("_")
    - f"{recording_date}_{cam_id}_{mouse_line}_{animal_id}_{paradigm}.mp4" =
    Example: "220922_Side_206_F2-12_OTT.mp4"

#### Folder structure 

  - A folder, in which a recordings is stored should match the followed structure to be 
    detected automatically:
    - has to start with the recording_date (YYMMDD)
    - has to end with any of the paradigms (as defined in project_config)
    - recording date and paradigm have to be separated by an underscore ("_")
    - f"{recording_date}_{paradigm}" = 
    Example: "230427_OF"

# let_it_be_3D

## Preprocess data to meet Anipose input requirements
- Synchronize video recordings of different framerates
- Intrinsic single-camera calibrations
- Marker detection (DLC, Template Matching, Manual annotations)

## Quality assurance
- 3D camera calibration (compare real-world & triangulation space)
- Visually check undistortion of images (validate camera intrinsics)

## Data Analysis
- Behavior
